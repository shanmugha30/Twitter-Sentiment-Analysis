# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
# Objective:
Objective of the task is to detect hate speech in tweets.For simplicity we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist sentiment associated with it.

Converting unstructured data into structured text and making text noise free is called text processing.It helps in getting rid of unwanted words and characters which helps in ontaining better features.
<b>The objective of step is to clean noise those are less relevant to find sentiment of tweets such as punctuation, special characters, numbers which do not carry weightage in context of text.</b>

Using stemming concept to reduce words to root/base word and removing unwanted numbers, punctuations, special characters helps is developing new features.

# Word Cloud:
Word cloud displays series of words.The word which occurs most frequent appears big in size and less number of times in small size.

# Extracting Features from Cleaned Tweets
1.Bag of Words

2.TF-IDF

3.Word Embeddings(word2vector)

# Evaluation Metric:
F1_Score is the metric used as it is weighthed average of precision and recall.It is suitable for uneven class distribution problems.

# Result:
Using Support Vector machine by using word-to-vector feature extraction method I obtained highest f1_Score.
